                <h5 class="p-name">20.01.17</h5>Hi, my name is Amber and I like words. Words like cognizant, parallel, and stupefy. English is my native language and I enjoy its nuances. I also enjoy other languages, especially German. I can't explain where my love of language came from. I didn't enjoy English classes at school and I took German classes on a whim. Playing with language makes me happy, no matter which one it is. Reeling off long, complicated sentences is fun - even more so when you have a friend to bounce them back at you. Is nothing in this world free? Words seem to be.

                <h5 class="p-name">21.01.17</h5>I feel like I should link each day's theme with the last. So, let's keep talking about language. I get a rush of englightening, fresh, and positive energy when I read a beautifully crafted, pertinent, yet deceptively simple sentence. I crave books that contain such prose. For example, Helen Macdonald in 'H for Hawk' writes "I stared at the sun going down and the sun coming up, and the sun in between". These ordinary, seemingly insignificant words perfectly capture, to me, the picture of a person taking time to quietly contemplate life whilst connecting to nature. At one with nature.

                <h5 class="p-name">22.01.17</h5>"Capture the mind and the heart and the body". This is something Don Norman said about designing things for people. I recently discovered this man after his book was recommended by Steve Krug in his book 'Don't Make Me Think'. I have seen videos of both men speaking and was really captivated and impressed by their humble natures and humility. Both seem really engaging, passionate and down to earth. These are qualities I really aspire to and I feel so happy I can learn from such people. The way design is entwined with psychology is so significant. This fascinates me.

                <h5 class="p-name">23.01.17</h5>Inspiration comes from an infinite amount of places. Just about anything that exists has the potential to inspire at least one person. What sorts of things follow on from inspiration? In some, it may manifest as a reason to get out of bed in the morning. To others, it might lead them onto great things. Then again, great things are achieved from a cumulation of thousands of tiny steps. Getting up in the morning counts as one of them. Little steps should be celebrated and effort should be praised, even if no discernible progress was made. Keep up the inspiration.

                <h5 class="p-name">24.01.17</h5>Once again my mental capacity cup runneth over with all the stuff I am trying to learn. Content management, conversion rates, static sites, blogs, CSS, SEO, databases, semantic code, JavaScript, user experience, logos, branding, analytics, design, what to do, what not to do, etcetera. The list goes on but these are things that immediately spring to mind. My mind, as it always has, constantly screams 'LEARN ALL THE THINGS!, while flooding me with the excitement this involves. Sometimes, I feel like I live inside a skydiving machine, with pieces of information flitting and floating about. Pieces eventually come together, relax.

                <h5 class="p-name">25.01.17</h5>There are certain characteristics, one may agree, which describe each generation. I know I couldn't succinctly list them all, or if anyone could. In my generation, and most likely even more so in the next, there seems to be a growing concern about instant gratification. How does this affect us all? This is certainly a broad question that cannot be answered in one paragraph. Personally, my thirst for it often holds me back from respecting certain time-honoured truths: good things take time, hard-work pays off, being kind to yourself and others brings peace and connection. Learn to enjoy the ride!

                <h5 class="p-name">26.01.17</h5>Does every person assume that others think how they think? This is something to watch in user research design. One of the many psychological intricacies one must consider in all steps of the design process. The job is not for one person in the team, but all members. A collective empathy is infinitely more powerful than when it is confined to one individual. However, empathy is not overt. It cannot be physically observed, so naturally has less emphasis and respect placed upon it. Empathy doesn't only form great products but also makes us better people. Put yourself in another's shoes.

                <h5 class="p-name">27.01.17</h5>The fundamental component of empathy may be the ability to put yourself in another person's shoes. Can you imagine how another person thinks or feels without this ability? If not, can you respect the opinions, wishes or desires of others? Lack of respect in any sphere rarely fosters positive relationships or good business. User research is person-centered, and the person is the client. This is a psychological term used in therapy, support plans and interventions. Psychology can help us create extraordinary user experiences when it is correctly focused. By the way, new favourite word, murmuration. A wild flock of starlings.

                <h5 class="p-name">28.01.17</h5>Something incredible about nature is the feelings it brings when all one does is quietly observe. If you want to clear your mind, soul, or lungs, nature is there. As well as bringing peace, nature brings me focus. On the occasional day I feel confused or unlike myself, stepping outside helps me. If I'm feeling reclusive, time spent outside among people can reignite my urge to connect with others. It reignites my passion and motivation. A person is a person because of people. It pays to remember we are an innately social species and connection with others is incredibly important.

                <h5 class="p-name">29.01.17</h5>There are some people who underestimate the power of connection with others. I've seen people blossom under its influence. Disconnection from others may breed irritation, contempt, even hatred. The reasons people choose to keep to themselves are plentiful, I'm sure. I think that information and education on the matter can help people understand how and why to become more connected. Can technology help with this? I think it can. Social media is one method, although it has been slammed for creating the opposite effect. What other methods exist? With the boom of smartphones, perhaps an app would do quite well.

I don't know the answer, although I'd like to learn. Indeed, I constantly feel my web-naivety slipping away.  I'm slowly learning that a quality app is not built in a day, by a single developer, on a single system. Most importantly, I now appreciate that a good app needs maintenance. This point taps into the life-long learning ethos of programming. Systems change, new ideas arise, fierce collaboration occurs. Loving learning sets you in good stead.

                <h5 class="p-name">31.01.17</h5>What do you like to learn about? How often do you learn it? Are there days you focus on it more? Why or why not? Curiosity may have killed the cat but I'm sure that learning in a safe and non-intrusive manner is always okay. Reading books or quietly tapping away on a laptop are harmless ways to learn. When might learning become unsafe? Curiosity may also engender gossip, or "unnecessary investigation or experimentation" as stated on Wikipedia. Gossip seems a natural human trait that fits with our penchant for learning. Curiosity killed the cat, but satisfaction brought it back.

                <h5 class="p-name">01.02.17</h5>Why do people work the way we do? We are a social species. Many of us search for what makes us different. I believe the greatest harmony arises by focusing on similarities. Isn't it a wonderful thought? To be able to say that some traits are shared amongst us all. 'Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs' is nice to think about. He lists physiological wellbeing, safety, love, belonging, and self-esteem as traits we all share, or at least long for. There may be others, too. Knowing what unites us fosters respect, understanding, and tolerance for any type of person we may meet.

                <h5 class="p-name">02.02.17</h5>How much does psychology really permeate different aspects of our lives? Why, if certain fundamental psychological principles exist, do people not consider these and act more kindly towards each other? Do negative feelings including jealousy and anger tend to override more positive ones, and, if so, why? Why is human nature so, that there is even a word to describe the pleasure we get when we see others fail? Schadenfreude. Is it the case that people expend effort to take the moral high ground but allow progress to evaporate at the whim of an emotion? Endless queries into human nature.

                <h5 class="p-name">08.02.17</h5>Yesterday, a developer at Codebar Brighton helped me implement a responsive navigation bar for my site. Due to my HTML and CSS being messy, the navbar did not work. I was advised to clean up my code to see if it helped. I'd been planning to do this anyway. Today, I created new files and copied over all non-obsolete code into them. I implemented the navbar code once more, and, voila! It worked. I achieved something today. A small victory but enough to get me publishing on Github once again. There's so much still to do, and not enough time!
